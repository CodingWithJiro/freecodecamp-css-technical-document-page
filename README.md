## ‚ÑπÔ∏è JavaScript Technical Reference Page

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project is a simple yet structured technical documentation page that covers core concepts in JavaScript. It includes sections such as variable declarations, data types, functions, and conditionals, formatted for readability and navigation.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## üîç Overview

The page mimics a real-world developer documentation format and features a fixed navigation sidebar linking to each major section of the document. On the right, a scrollable main content area holds the detailed JavaScript topics, formatted using semantic HTML for accessibility and clarity.

The layout is fully responsive‚Äîtransforming into a mobile-friendly flow for smaller screens. CSS media queries ensure the sidebar stacks properly and the content remains accessible.
